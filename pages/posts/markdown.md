## Favourite tasks - PS: Selecting 5 from the list is difficult and I do like more than 5 task.
1. Respond to 50+ support requests via email every day - This is my job role's most important requirement and would keep doing this since it keeps me up to date with the issues customers are facing and we can find a trend through them and share the same with the product team. Also we can develop new feature using that trend.
2. Dig through logs to troubleshoot a customer's broken project - Its my most favourite part as being a support agent. It helped in troubleshooting the customer issues and provided them the much needed resolution, since this is the basic and foremost important responsibility of a support agent.
3. Act as a dedicated CSE for a handful of key customers to ensure their success using Vercel - I am currently working in this role itself and would love to continue the same.
4. Manage a support team - It is my second most important task, I want to manage a team because I am confident that I can train and develop my associates to display excellent customer support skills. I intend to lead by example by showing appropriate customer support and providing training for associates.
5. Write and maintain support articles and docs pages - I used to do this and i would love to continue doing this, since it reduces our tickets and make the process easier for the customer in case of implementation or any issue they are facing with the product.
6. Help train and onboard new support teammates - I am doing this task from at least last 4 years and would love to keep doing it.
## Least favourite task: As such this is not the list that i dont like but would like to reduce their priority.
1. Help resolve billing issues for customers - This is one of the least favourite tasks, since billing of each customer can vary based on their contract and usage and you need to dig deep to get correct info and share the same with the customer.
2. Work with 3rd party partners to track down a tricky situation for a joint customer - This is the second most favourite task, since this adds a third front in fixing the issue for a customer and each company has their own way in assisting customers or other parties.
3. Respond to queries on Twitter, Reddit, Hacker News and other 3rd party sites - This is another least favourite task for me, since on social media we can be less technical and vocal when sharing our fixes with the customer.
4. Engage multiple users at once in a public discussion, to answer their questions and troubleshoot problems - This situation becomes tricky, since multiple people have multiple questions and resolution can vary.
## Only able to find the above as least fav. Task. I am really sorry for that but would love to do the following too:
1. Identify, file (and, where possible, resolve) bugs in private and public Vercel/Next.js repos on GitHub
2. Find and recruit teammates for the support team 
3. Run ticket review sessions to make sure tone is consistent
4. Work with the product team to develop a new feature based on feedback from customers
5. Analyze hundreds of support tickets to spot trends the product team can use
6. Work with engineering teams during incidents and provide updates to internal and external stakeholders
7. Scheduling time-off coverage and collaborating as part of a growing cohesive support team
8. Work with people to figure out if Vercel is suitable for their use case
