Hello First name,

Thanks for reaching out to us at Vercel Support.
My name is Arpit and I will be assisting on your requested query.

In order to redirect from <b>/hello-vercel</b> to <b>https://vercel.com</b>, please follow the below steps:
1. Login into the Vercel Dashboard
2. Navigate to the Settings page for the project and select the Domains section from Menu items.
3. First and foremost please add a new domain <b>https://vercel.com</b> to the project, if it's not already added.
4. Once added, kindly select the sub domain /hello-vercel and click on the edit button.
5. You will be shown a new view, having Redirect to.
6. By default there is “no redirect” selected, which means that the domain is not redirected to a different domain.
7. To create a redirect, all you need to do is select the domain <b>https://verce.com</b>, from the "Redirects to" field and it is done.

Thanks and Regards,
