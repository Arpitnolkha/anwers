## Learning and its importance
Learning for me is my day to day part of my job, i would love to keep doing my daily responsibilities i.e. assisting customers with that, I will always look for opportunities to learn new things and keep growing myself so that I can remain helpful to my organisation and my colleagues. For me learning is a never ending process and you need to keep learning so that you can remain in sync with the ongoing trends and keep adjusting yourself with the same.
However, I would love to learn management skills, I want to increase my technical horizon, data analysis and working with the different stakeholders to make things easier for the team and the customer.
